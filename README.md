🐈🐕 Animal Society 🐈🐕

🐶 This is an animal-themed web social media

🐱 Building by React, NodeJS and MongoDB

🐮 Implemented MUI, Formik, Redux, ExpressJS, and Mongoose for development

🙉 Explored Testing Framework - Cypress

🐣 Applied Git and Github with different branches for version control/source control

🐧 Working in a team setting for simulating an industrial working environment

Highlights of working in a team setting:
- We have a meeting weekly to update what we accomplished and what should we target to accomplish the next week
- We explored and applied branch protection rules in Github, to avoid merging a wrong version to the main branch, and also to get all team members' approval before merging to the main branch
